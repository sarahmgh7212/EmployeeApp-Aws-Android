# EmployeeApp-Aws-Android
We were looking to do a program that could efficiently utilise multiple cloud based services and different APIs
while also keeping the app design relatively simple,being easy to use and understandable for all types of users.
"Employee Tracker" is an application that allows empoyers to keep track of their employees' information and data in AWS cloud system.
It can be tailored to whatever certain companies need. For instance, every manager signed up with this app, can see all emplyees' profiles
along with their details such as Name, Role, Profile picture and so on.
All the data is synched with AWS DynamoDB and S3 buckets. Each manager that logs in, their email address is stored as username within
AWS Cognito, all managers see the same version of data as other managers.
